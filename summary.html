        The topic of this website is just a recap of what my first year of college was like. I am almost done with my first year at USC. With the school year coming to an end, I would like to take some time to make a memory board of sorts to reflect on my time here. Each one of the photos below represents something important to my college career, and will direct you to another page with more information. Each page has more detailed information, with the extraâ€™s page being a short blurb about some friends at USC. It is a carousel that switches to a different friend when you do not hover over the image. I used a javascript plugin that makes elements fly in. <a href="https://www.jqueryscript.net/animation/jQuery-Plugin-To-Create-Elements-Fly-in-Effects-On-Scroll.html">This is the doc</a>  The other extra that I did was use transformations to create the hover effect on the homepage to let the user read more if they hover over the corresponding image in my timeline.
